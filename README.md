# Shopiy-Backend-Challenge

This is my implementation of the image reposistory challenge using Django and Django Rest Framework. 

How to locally run the project:
 
1) git clone 
2) CD into project directory.

3) Activate your virtual env.

4) run pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies.

5) Remote HTTPS protocl from from settings.py

6) Run Python manage.py runserver.



REST API Documentation.

Swagger was used for api documentation. The documentation url is http://127.0.0.1/


Functionalities.

Add/register user: You can add and register users.

Upload/ delete Image: Users can upload image. Users only have the permission to delete their own images. 

update Image: Users can update an image.

Frontend.

I built a frontend for this project using react js. The frontend can be found https://github.com/jallowmoha/Shopiy-Backend-Challenge/tree/master/frontend.



Next Step:

I came across the challenge a day before the due date so time was not on my side. If I had little bit of time I would have implemented these functionalities:

1) Search function.
2) Api pagination 
3) Deploy the project on Heroku, AWS or pythonanywhere.
4) Used postgres as database instead of sqlite.
5) Add more user interface such as like buttons.
